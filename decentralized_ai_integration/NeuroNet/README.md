# NeuroNet

NeuroNet is a high-tech decentralized application framework designed to facilitate the development of blockchain-based applications, AI components, and user behavior analysis. This project aims to provide a robust and scalable architecture for building decentralized applications (dApps) with advanced features.

## Features

- **Blockchain Functionality**: A fully functional blockchain implementation with transaction handling and mining capabilities.
- **AI Components**: Integration of AI models for predictive analytics and user behavior analysis.
- **Security Features**: Robust security measures including encryption, password hashing, and JWT authentication.
- **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Example dApp implementation with a user-friendly interface.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/Blockchain-Nexus.git
   cd Blockchain-Nexus/neuronet
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   1 python -m venv venv
   2 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   1 pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
## Running the Application
To run the example dApp, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   1 python src/dapps/example_dapp/app.py
   ```
The application will be available at http://localhost:5001.

## Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   1 pytest tests/
   ```
