# NeuroNet Architecture Overview

## Introduction
NeuroNet is a cutting-edge platform that integrates blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to provide secure, decentralized applications. This document outlines the architecture of the NeuroNet system, detailing its components and interactions.

## High-Level Architecture
The architecture of NeuroNet can be divided into three main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: 
   - This layer includes the user interface and client-side applications (dApps) that interact with the backend services.

2. **Application Layer**: 
   - This layer contains the core functionalities, including:
     - **Blockchain Module**: Manages the blockchain, transactions, and consensus mechanisms.
     - **AI Module**: Implements machine learning models for predictions and anomaly detection.
     - **Security Module**: Ensures data protection through encryption and authentication.

3. **Data Layer**: 
   - This layer consists of the blockchain ledger and any additional databases used for storing non-blockchain data.

## Component Interaction
- The presentation layer communicates with the application layer via RESTful APIs.
- The application layer interacts with the blockchain and AI modules to process data and execute transactions.
- Security protocols are enforced at every layer to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

## Conclusion
The NeuroNet architecture is designed for scalability, security, and efficiency, enabling the development of robust decentralized applications.
