# Governance Models in MetaLedger

## Introduction
MetaLedger employs various governance models to ensure decentralized decision-making and community participation.

## Governance Models

### 1. Token-Based Governance
- **Description**: Stakeholders use tokens to vote on proposals. The weight of each vote is proportional to the number of tokens held.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for projects where financial investment correlates with governance influence.

### 2. Liquid Democracy
- **Description**: Allows users to delegate their voting power to trusted representatives. Users can revoke delegation at any time.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for dynamic communities where expertise varies across different topics.

### 3. Quadratic Voting
- **Description**: Users allocate votes based on the intensity of their preferences. The cost of additional votes increases quadratically.
- **Use Case**: Encourages more nuanced decision-making and prevents majority tyranny.

## Implementation
Each governance model is implemented as a smart contract on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. Users can participate in governance through the dApps interface.

## Conclusion
The governance models in MetaLedger empower users to have a say in the platform's direction, fostering a collaborative and engaged community.
