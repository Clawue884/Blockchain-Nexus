# MetaLedger Architecture

## Overview
MetaLedger is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to facilitate secure transactions, decentralized identity management, and community governance. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy integration of new features and scalability.

## Components
- **Core Layer**: Responsible for the fundamental blockchain functionalities, including transaction processing, block management, and consensus algorithms.
- **Identity Layer**: Manages decentralized identities, ensuring privacy and security through cryptographic techniques.
- **Governance Layer**: Implements governance models that allow stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes.
- **dApps Layer**: Supports the development and deployment of decentralized applications, providing templates and tools for developers.

## Data Flow
1. **Transaction Creation**: Users create transactions through the dApps layer.
2. **Transaction Validation**: Transactions are validated by the core layer using consensus algorithms.
3. **Block Creation**: Validated transactions are grouped into blocks and added to the blockchain.
4. **Identity Verification**: The identity layer verifies user identities as needed.
5. **Governance Participation**: Users can propose and vote on governance issues through the governance layer.
