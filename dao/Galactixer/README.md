# Galactixer DAO

Galactixer is a high-tech Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages smart contracts to facilitate governance, proposal management, and multi-signature wallet functionalities, enabling a decentralized and democratic decision-making process.

## Features

- **Proposal Creation**: Members can create proposals for new features or changes.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Members can vote on proposals, with safeguards against double voting.
- **Multi-Signature Wallet**: A secure wallet that requires multiple approvals for transactions.
- **Tokenomics**: Utilizes a custom ERC20 token for governance and voting.
