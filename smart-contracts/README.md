# Smart Contracts for dApps

## Overview
This directory contains the smart contracts for the dApps Builder project. The contracts are written in Solidity and are designed to facilitate the core functionalities of the decentralized application.

## Contracts
- **DAppContract.sol**: The main contract that handles user deposits, withdrawals, and balance management.
- **Migrations.sol**: A contract to manage the deployment of other contracts.

## Migrations
The migration scripts are used to deploy the contracts to the blockchain. The initial migration script is included in this directory.

## Testing
The test directory contains tests for the DAppContract to ensure that all functionalities work as expected. Tests are written using Mocha and Chai.

## Truffle Configuration
The `truffle-config.js` file contains the configuration for deploying the contracts to different networks, including development, Ropsten, and Mainnet.
