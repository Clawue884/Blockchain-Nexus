# QuantumChain

QuantumChain is a next-generation blockchain platform designed to be resistant to quantum computing threats. This project aims to provide a secure, scalable, and efficient blockchain solution for decentralized applications (dApps).

## Features

- **Quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms**: Utilizes advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and data against quantum attacks.
- **Peer-to-peer networking**: Implements a decentralized network for node communication.
- **Support for decentralized applications (dApps)**: Allows developers to build and deploy dApps on the QuantumChain platform.
- **Comprehensive testing suite**: Ensures the reliability and security of the platform through rigorous testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/Blockchain-Nexus.git
   2 cd Blockchain-Nexus/QuantumChain
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   1 pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your settings in the config.json file (create it if it doesn't exist):

   ```json
   1 {
   2     "node_url": "http://localhost:8545",
   3     "deployer_address": "0xYourDeployerAddress",
   4     "private_key": "YourPrivateKey",
   5     "node_port": 5001
   6 }
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   1 python scripts/run_node.py
   ```

5. Deploy a smart contract:

   ```bash
   1 python scripts/deploy.py
   ```

6. Generate cryptographic keys:

   ```bash
   1 python scripts/generate_keys.py
   ```
