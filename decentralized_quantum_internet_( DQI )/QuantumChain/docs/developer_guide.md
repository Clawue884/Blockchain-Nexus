# QuantumChain Developer Guide

## Introduction
This guide is intended for developers who want to build on the QuantumChain platform. It covers the architecture, development environment setup, and best practices for creating decentralized applications (dApps).

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js
- Git
- Familiarity with blockchain concepts

### Cloning the Repository
Clone the QuantumChain repository:
```bash
1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/Blockchain-Nexus.git
2 cd Blockchain-Nexus/QuantumChain
```

## Setting Up the Environment
1. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
1 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies for dApp development:

```bash
1 cd src/dapps/dapp_template
2 npm install
```

## Building dApps
### Creating a New dApp
- Create a new directory under src/dapps/.
- Use the provided dapp_template as a starting point.
- Implement your smart contracts in smart_contract.py.
- Develop the frontend in the frontend/ directory.

### Smart Contract Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a smart contract:

```python
1 class SimpleStorage:
2     def __init__(self):
3         self.data = {}
4 
5     def set_data(self, key, value):
6         self.data[key] = value
7 
8     def get_data(self, key):
9         return self.data.get(key, None)
```

## Testing Your dApp
Use the testing framework provided in the tests/ directory to ensure your dApp functions correctly:

```bash
1 python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Conclusion
This developer guide provides thenecessary information to get started with building on the QuantumChain platform. For further details on specific components, refer to the API Reference documentation.
