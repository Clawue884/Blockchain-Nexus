# Security Best Practices

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure that all user accounts have strong, unique passwords.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the software updated to patch any vulnerabilities.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: Where possible, enable 2FA for an additional layer of security.
- **Secure API Keys**: Store API keys securely and do not expose them in public repositories.
