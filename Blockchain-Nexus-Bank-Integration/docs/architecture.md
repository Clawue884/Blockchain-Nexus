# Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This document outlines the architecture of the Blockchain Nexus integration for global banks. The architecture is designed to ensure scalability, security, and compliance with regulatory standards.

## Components
The architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **Blockchain Layer**:
   - The underlying blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger) that facilitates decentralized transactions and smart contracts.

2. **Core Services**:
   - **Blockchain Connector**: Interfaces with the blockchain network to send and receive transactions.
   - **Transaction Manager**: Manages the lifecycle of transactions, including creation, signing, and broadcasting.

3. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Deployed contracts that handle specific banking functions such as payments, identity verification, and asset tokenization.

4. **API Layer**:
   - RESTful APIs that expose functionalities to external systems and applications, allowing for seamless integration with existing banking systems.

5. **Compliance Services**:
   - Services for KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) that ensure regulatory compliance.

6. **User  Interface**:
   - A web or mobile interface for bank employees and customers to interact with the blockchain services.

## Data Flow
1. Users initiate transactions through the User Interface.
2. The API Layer receives requests and communicates with the Core Services.
3. The Transaction Manager processes the transaction and interacts with the Blockchain Connector.
4. The Blockchain Connector sends the transaction to the blockchain network.
5. Smart Contracts execute the necessary logic and return results to the Transaction Manager.
6. Compliance Services validate transactions against regulatory requirements.

## Security Considerations
- All sensitive data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to critical components.
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should be conducted.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a robust framework for integrating global banks with Blockchain Nexus, ensuring efficiency, security, and compliance.
