# System Architecture

## Overview
The ElysiumNetwork is designed to facilitate sustainable practices through blockchain technology. This document outlines the architecture of the system, including its components and interactions.

## Components
- **Core Blockchain**: Manages transactions, blocks, and consensus mechanisms.
- **Identity Management**: Handles decentralized identity and verification.
- **Governance Model**: Implements community governance through voting and proposals.
- **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Provides user-facing applications for carbon credit trading and energy sharing.
- **Analytics**: Offers tools for data analysis and reporting on sustainability metrics.

## Interaction Flow
1. Users interact with dApps to perform transactions.
2. Transactions are processed by the core blockchain.
3. Identity verification is performed as needed.
4. Governance decisions are made through the voting system.
5. Analytics tools provide insights into system performance and sustainability metrics.
