# ElysiumNetwork

ElysiumNetwork is a decentralized platform designed to facilitate carbon credit trading, energy market transactions, and governance models using blockchain technology. This project aims to create a transparent and efficient system for tracking carbon credits and promoting sustainable energy practices.

## Features

- **Blockchain Functionality**: A robust blockchain implementation for secure and transparent transactions.
- **Carbon Credit Tracking**: Mint, transfer, and validate carbon credits.
- **Energy Market**: Facilitate energy trading between users.
- **Governance Models**: Implement decentralized governance for decision-making.
- **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Support for building and deploying dApps on the platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js (for running dApps)
- Access to an Ethereum node (e.g., Infura)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/Blockchain-Nexus.git
   2 cd Blockchain-Nexus/ElysiumNetwork
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   1 python -m venv venv
   2 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   1 pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application
- To deploy smart contracts, run:

   ```bash
   1 python scripts/deploy.py
   ```

- To run a blockchain node, execute:

   ```bash
   1 python scripts/run_node.py
   ```

- To generate cryptographic keys, use:

   ```bash
   1 python scripts/generate_keys.py
   ```

- To set up a decentralized identity, run:

   ```bash
   1 python scripts/setup_identity.py
   ```

- To mint carbon credits, execute:

   ```bash
   1 python scripts/carbon_credit_minting.py
   ```

### Running Tests
To run the tests, use:

   ```bash
   1 pytest src/tests/
   ```
