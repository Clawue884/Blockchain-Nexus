# User Manual

Welcome to the Quantum Nexus Protocol! This user manual will guide you through the process of setting up and using the protocol.

## Setting up a Wallet

To get started, you'll need to set up a wallet. Follow the prompts in the wallet software to create a new wallet and fund it with the desired cryptocurrency.

## Initiating a Transaction

To initiate a transaction, open your wallet, select the "Send" option, enter the recipient's address and the amount, review the details, and confirm the transaction.

## Using Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. Create a new smart contract, define the terms, deploy it to the blockchain, and interact with it by sending transactions to the contract address.
