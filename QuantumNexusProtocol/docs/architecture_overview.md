# Architecture Overview

The Quantum Nexus Protocol is a decentralized, blockchain-based platform that leverages quantum computing and artificial intelligence to enable secure, efficient, and scalable transactions.

## Components

The protocol consists of the following components:

- **Blockchain Layer**: A decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions and smart contract interactions.
- **Quantum Layer**: A quantum computing module that enables secure, post-quantum cryptography and advanced AI capabilities.
- **AI Functionalities**: A set of artificial intelligence modules that provide predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and sentiment analysis.
- **Interoperability Features**: A set of APIs and interfaces that enable seamless interactions between different blockchain networks and traditional systems.
